      The base job for OpenStack's installation of Zuul.

      All jobs ultimately inherit from this.  It runs a pre-playbook
      which copies all of the job's prepared git repos on to all of
      the nodes in the nodeset.  It runs a post-playbook which copies
      all of the files in the logs/ directory of every node on to the
      logserver.

      It also sets default timeout and nodeset values (which may be
      overidden).

    # ridiculous.  That will be fixed too.
